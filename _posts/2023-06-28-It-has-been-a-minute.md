It's been 10000 years since my last blog post here. This was supposed to be my space to do writeups of CTFs, share things I learn along the way and also my personal journery on my running adeventures but alas, I neglected this space.
</p>
<p>
I have been pondering on reviving my blog but everytime it just becomes too much and I think to myself but why should I. The intention was not to do it for myself but to share my journey with others in the hopes to teach or help others along the way. I don't want to sound all egotistical but I used to do running videos on my Youtube channel which I LOVED to make on a weekly basis to not only keep myself in check but to show my running journey and inspire others. Over the years people would tell me that the videos and journey inspired them to take up running and put them on a healthier path. 
</p>
<p>
When the big C hit in 2020, running and videos were not there due to lockdown and I pretty much did not have my place of release and solitude to help with the mentalspace. Work was also not going that great as I was unmotivated in the position I was in. I was at the time trying to get into the Information Security space and a lot of promises were said but sadly it was not forthcoming and the demotivation was getting worse. Not a great headspace to be in. It was towards August when I had an opportunity I could not refuse. It was scary and nervwrecking at the time as the opportunity presented was a door opening into the security field that I have been trying to get into for the last while. This new opportunity was also a trial period to "prove" that I was capable of doing it. I was at a comfortable job that I had been at for over 10 years and breaking away from that was the most anxious thing I could do. So many questions and doubt came over me...what if I fail...what if this is all rainbows and butterflies on the outside and then a dissapointment on the inside? more on this later...
On top of that, I had a health scare at the time too which also put a damper on my running plus we had to move out of our current rental and was getting denied because I could not provide proof of a "stable" job because I had changed jobs.

December 2020 I got the go ahead from the doctor I could run again. I WAS STOKED. I had running goals for 2021 and I was determined to acheive them despite having to start my running journey over again. January 2021 I decided to enter for Ultra Trail Drakensberg 100km. YES, 100km. I had a coach at the time and when I told him he just laughed but and did the best he could to get me fit enough to tackle the challenge. I did not document the process and looking back at it, I wish I did. 4:30am on April 27th I crossed the finish line and completed the 100km. Proudest moment of my life. When you put your mind to it, you can accomplish most of it. 2 weeks after UTD I had a fall which required 7 stitches on my knee and I was not able to walk or run for 2 months. I had entered 2 other 100km for the last part of 2021 but needless to say, it did not end up the same as I had to pull out at 60km in both the Cederberg Traverse and Ultra Trail Cape Town due to a foot injury I picked up during the traning leading up to them as I suspect I did too much too quickly.
</p>
<p>
2022 was focused on getting the foot injury sorted and only by October was I able to enter for Maxi Races 45km which was a sign that things were looking up. Soon after that race, I had my eyes set on Ultra Tail Drakensberg 100km in 2023 as I wanted to prove to myself that I still have the determination and grit. Training was worse than 2021 and although I had some doubts leading up to it, during the race it was touch and go with some very low moments during. There was nothing more joyous than crossing the line and getting a huge hug from your supportive wife. The mind beat the body and I was truly excited for the next challenges that lay ahead. 
</p>
<p>
For 2023, I have only one race goal, Maxi Races 45km again and to just beat my personal best from 2022. Sadly, I picked up an injury a few weeks back with a twisted ankle but at least Maxi is a few months away so it's not bothering me too much but sadly I have not been able to run for the past few weeks which is a bit of an issue, not only from a training perspective but also a mental headspace. 
</p>
<p>
With that being said, let's go back to 2020 when I started my journey into the Information Security space.
New job meant new things, new excitement and everyting that comes with a new position. I had a rejuvination and excitment again despite not being able to run.
